## Project Title:
Predicting FinTech Bootcamp Graduate Salaries

#

## Project Team Members:
- Andrew Crawford

#

## Project Description/Outline:

Our project is to research and learn what salaries are possible with skills obtained in this FinTech Bootcamp.  We will be using the Monster India API which includes salaries in rupees since the US-based API required a significant fee to use.  We will use the API to retrieve data regarding job descriptions, skills, and salaries to determine the following:
- What jobs require skills from this bootcamp?
- What are the potential jobs and salaries for graduates with these skills?
- Can we predict an accurate salary range based on these skills?

#

## Datasets Used:
We will be using data obtained from the Monster India API.
- https://crawlfeeds.com/datasets/monster-india-jobs-dataset    
  
We will also be using the following skills obtained during this FinTech Bootcamp:
1. SQL
2. Python
3. API
4. Algorithm
5. AWS
6. Forecast
7. Big data

#

## Brief Background of Top Skills and Job Descriptions:
As part of the U of MN FinTech Bootcamp, we have obtained the necessary skills to automate and improve financial services using cutting-edge technology.  Skills gained include the following:

We selected seven key skills from this list to use in our analysis, as mentioned above.  
#

##  Data Preparation and Analysis:
Based on our review of the data included in the Monster India API, we compelted the following key steps:
1. Data Cleanup:  Cleaned the data in order to achieve reasonable results, such as removing job postings without salary information (those that say "Not Disclosed"), removed unnecessary columns, checked for nulls, etc.  
2.  Data Analysis - We reviewed our updated data and dropped any jobs that did not include any keywords (selected skills).  We then converted the salary from Indian rupees to US dollars and reset the index.
3. Training/Testing - ADD
4. Prediction Model - ADD
5. Chatbot - ADD

#

## Additional Notes:
Please note that salaries are in rupees and not U.S. dollars.  We converted the salaries to US dollars after data cleanup, but keep in mind these salaries are based in India and may be lower than those in the US.
